# TVbeat Dashboard Updates

## Audience builder & Indexing update
*10 April, 2018*

### Audience Builder
The TVbeat **Audience Builder** provides allows you to build, save and export audience segments via user or device IDs created from your 1st party data.

The latest release features an upgrade to the existing target audience bar visible across the TVbeat dashboard. It is now simpler and quicker to build multiple new segments, and those audience segments can now be used in other reporting within the TVbeat dashboard.

The new Audience Builder view enables you to view all of your created segments. The Create/Edit rules mean you can now build multi-level conditions with AND/OR operators to pin-point specific audiences. An audience segment can also be built from a list of imported subscribers into the TVbeat platform.


### Indexing
The TVbeat Indexing Report allows you to analyse strongly or poorly performing data points such as channel or program against a base segment.

The latest upgrade includes:
* Visual improvements to the first column view when comparing The base segment against selected Audience segments.

* A new Chart views where you can view your comparative data sets in two charts. 
  * Chart 1 provides an index comparison of the selected audience segments.
