## Basics

+ **Universe**: A population of multichannel households to which sample is weighted and balanced to. Universe for Croatia is 750.000 households.
+ **BTU** - Base Time Unit: 1 minute, all calculations are minute based
+ **HUT** - Households using TV: number of television homes using one or more television sets during the a specified time period.

## Weighting and weight distribution

Household data is weighted (RIM weighting) and expanded platforms subscriber data.
Weights are applied at subscriber level. Each device is assigned an internal
weight within a household, this weight is based on the amount of viewing
on the specific device. Household weight is than distributed among devices
based on this internal weight. RIM weighting is currently done on two
characteristics: region and number of devices

## Zap interval
Is a minimum time interval that a HH has to be tuned to a given channel in
order for that viewing to be attributed to said channel. Zap
interval is 5 seconds, and these seconds are counted into total viewing
if the threshold is reached (ie. if viewing is longer than 5 seconds).

## Metrics

### **Rating (RTG)**
Rating is calculated as a proportion of active households within their
relevant universe. As base time unit is one minute, base unit of rating is average minute
rating, a number of HHs tuned to a given minute. 

It is calculated as:
``` Total duration / duration or emission / universe ```

### **Share (SHR)**
Is defined as a fraction of rating over HUT rating.

### **Reach (RCH)**
Is defined as a number of unique HHs that have viewed a specified time period (5 sec) of a given channel over another, broader specified time period. 

### **Average duration**
Is defined as the average times that those that have watched the content in question spent viewing it. Average duration (value in the table) is adjusted for the interval selected in the dashboard (minute, hour, day, total). To illustrate, if selected interval is one minute, than average duration value in the table represents average MINUTE duration for the selected period, same goes for all intervals. For total interval, average duration represents number of minutes viewed per device for the entire selected period.

It is calculated as:
``` Total duration / Reach ```

All minute values are presented in decimal number format and calculated like this: 72 seconds are presented as 1.2 min (72/60).
