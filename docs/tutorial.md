# Tutorial

This documentation provides a brief tutorial on how to use the features and tools on the TVbeat dashboard. 

## Audience builder
The **Audience Builder** enables the users to create and manage, simple and/or detailed audience segments. In the audience segments users are
able to filter out a specific set of subscribers. Once an audience segment is created, the users are able to use it though out the dashboard to
define their target audience.

Let's go thorugh an example of creating, using and managing audience segments.

#### Creating a new **Audience Segment**
There are two ways of creating an audience segment. 

We can do it through the **Audience Segment Picker** which is displayed in the green bar in tools like Segmentation, Expoter, Index etc.

In  **Segmentation** we can see the green bar and a picker which by default we have the **ALL - Total audience**. This basically means we 
are including the entire viewership/subscriber base.

By clicking on the **Audience segment picker** we are presented with a menu which includes a list of already created audience 
segments(empty if none has been created yet) and at the bottom a **Create a new audience** button.

Clicking on the **Create a new audience** button redirects you to the Audience Builder creation tool. Here we can either build our segment
with various filters to filter out our viewership data or we can import a list of subscribers via "**.txt**" or "**.csv**" file. We can 
switch between these two options with the tabs in the top bar("Build your Target audience" or "Import subscriber list").

We first enter a title of the audience segment(a default title is generated at the beggining). 

Bellow the title we have our filter bars where we add our filters. We can also add AND/OR conditions between filters 
which gives us more flexibility in creating more complex audiences.

Lets create simple audience segment called **Young techies**. We want a Male audience, aged between 25-35 who are interested in Technology.

NOTE: The filters may differ depending on what dimensions a specific dataset provides.
