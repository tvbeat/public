Each device is asigned an internal\r\nweight within a household, this weight is based on the amount of viewing\r\non the specific device. Household weight is than distributed among devices\r\nbased on this internal weight. RIM weighting is currently done on two\r\ncharacteristics: region and number of devices\r\n\r\n##### Channel persistence\r\nIs a minimum time interval that a HH has to be tuned to a given channel in\r\norder for that viewing to be attributed to said channel. Channel\r\npersistence is 5 seconds, and these seconds are counted into total viewing\r\nif the threshold is reached (ie. if viewing is longer than 5 seconds).\r\n\r\n### Metrics\r\n\r\n##### Rating (RTG)\r\nRating is calculated as a proportion of active households within their\r\nrelevant universe. As base time unit is one minute, base unit of rating is average minute\r\nrating, a number of HHs tuned to a given minute. For spots each spot will\r\ninherit a rating of the break it is part of, and breaks will have their on\r\nratings inherited from the minutes they are part of. Since our BTU is a\r\nminute this means that breaks will get the rating of the minute (full\r\nminute) that they are most in, and spots will inherit this rating.\r\n\r\n##### Share (SHR)\r\nIs defined as a fraction of rating over Total TV rating.\r\n\r\n##### Reach (RCH)\r\nIs defined as a number of unique HHs that have viewed a specified time\r\nperiod (X) of a given channel over a another, broader specified time period\r\n(Y). X can be consecutive, but does not have to be. At the moment X cannot\r\nbe modified and is set to ONE non consecutive minute.\r\n\r\n##### Total duration\r\nIs defined as the sum of durations of all households that have watched\r\ngiven content\r\n\r\n##### Average duration\r\nIs defined as the average times that those that have watched the content in\r\nquestion spent viewing it. It is calculated as `[Active Households Total\r\nDuration / Households]`\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
